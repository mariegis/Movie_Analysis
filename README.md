# Movie_Analysis
This project analyzes a number of movie datasets as included in the Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers in order to better understand the success of movies within other studios. The goal of this analysis is to then assess and help create business recommendations to present to Microsoft, as they attempt to open and manage their own movie studio.
